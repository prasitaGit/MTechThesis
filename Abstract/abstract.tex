\begin{abstracts}

Finding winning strategies for \textit{Player~1} (the system) against \textit{Player~2} (the environment) in graph games is the basis for synthesizing controllers satisfying a specification. In many situations where winning strategies do not exist, it is important to compute the best-effort (or admissible) strategies. The thesis aims to compute admissible strategies for safety and reachability objectives in graph games.
