I express my sincere gratitude towards my guide \textbf{Dr. Purandar Bhaduri} for his constant support, encouragement and inspiration throughout the project work. I specially acknowledge him for his advice, supervision, and the vital contribution as and when required. It is because of his constant and general interest and assistance that this project has been successful. 

I want to acknowledge my parents for motivating me and providing moral support during the course time of M.Tech. I also want to acknowledge the Department Of Computer Science  and inter department teaching members for helping me by giving the basic idea.
